      "Abstract: Dysregulation of Hippo pathway leads to hyperactivation of YAP-TEAD transcriptional complex in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we observed that HHEX (Hematopoietically expressed homeobox) may enhance transcription activity of the YAP-TEAD complex. HHEX associates with and stabilizes the YAP-TEAD complex on the regulatory genomic loci to coregulate the expression of a group of YAP/TEAD target genes. Also, HHEX may indirectly regulate these target genes by controlling YAP/TAZ expression. Importantly, HHEX is required for the pro-tumorigenic effects of YAP during CRC progression. In response to serum stimulation, CK2 (Casein Kinase 2) phosphorylates HHEX and enhances its interaction with TEAD4. A CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 diminishes the interaction between HHEX and TEAD4, leading to decreased expression of YAP/TEAD target genes. CX-4945 synergizes the antitumor activity of YAP-TEAD inhibitors verteporfin and Super-TDU. Elevated expression of HHEX is correlated with hyperactivation of YAP/TEAD and associated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. Overall, our study identifies HHEX as a positive modulator of YAP/TEAD to promote colorectal tumorigenesis, providing a new therapeutic strategy for targeting YAP/TEAD in CRC.\n",

      "Abstract: One of the multiple sclerosis (MS) risk polymorphisms, rs7923837, maps near the HHEX (hematopoietically-expressed homeobox) gene. This variant has also been associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility and with triglyceride levels, suggesting its metabolic involvement. HHEX plays a relevant role as a negative regulator of inflammatory genes in microglia. A reciprocal repression was reported between HHEX and BCL6, another putative risk factor in MS. The present study evidenced statistically significant lower HHEX mRNA levels in lymphocytes of MS patients compared to those of controls, showing a similar trend in MS patients to the already described eQTL effect in blood from healthy individuals. Even though no differences were found in protein expression according to HHEX genotypes, statistically significant divergent subcellular distributions of HHEX appeared in patients and controls. The epistatic interaction detected between BCL6 and HHEX MS-risk variants in healthy individuals was absent in patients, indicative of a perturbed reciprocal regulation in the latter. Lymphocytes from MS carriers of the homozygous mutant genotype exhibited a distinctive, more energetic profile, both in resting and activated conditions, and significantly increased glycolytic rates in resting conditions when compared to controls sharing the HHEX genotype. In contrast, significantly higher mitochondrial mass was evidenced in homozygous mutant controls.\n",

      "Abstract: The pancreas and liver arise from a common pool of progenitors. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive their lineage diversification from the foregut endoderm are not fully understood. To tackle this question, we undertook a multifactorial approach that integrated human pluripotent-stem-cell-guided differentiation, genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening, single-cell analysis, genomics and proteomics. We discovered that HHEX, a transcription factor (TF) widely recognized as a key regulator of liver development, acts as a gatekeeper of pancreatic lineage specification. HHEX deletion impaired pancreatic commitment and unleashed an unexpected degree of cellular plasticity towards the liver and duodenum fates. Mechanistically, HHEX cooperates with the pioneer TFs FOXA1, FOXA2 and GATA4, shared by both pancreas and liver differentiation programmes, to promote pancreas commitment, and this cooperation restrains the shared TFs from activating alternative lineages. These findings provide a generalizable model for how gatekeeper TFs like HHEX orchestrate lineage commitment and plasticity restriction in broad developmental contexts.\n",

      "Abstract: Microglia have diverse physiological and pathological functions. However, the transcriptional mechanisms remain elusive. Here we sought new transcription factors relevant to microglial functions from the microglial transcriptome of stressed mice and evaluated their roles in primary microglia. TLR2 and TLR4 agonists increased Rel, Atf3, and Cebpb and decreased Hhex in primary microglia as repeated social defeat stress. Although Hhex was not studied in microglia, TLR2 and TLR4 agonists decreased Hhex, and Hhex overexpression attenuated TLR4-increased expression of inflammation-related genes. These findings suggest that Hhex negatively regulates inflammation-related genes in microglia and that TLR2/4 activation reduces Hhex, facilitating TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation.\n",

      "Abstract: We investigated the role of hematopoietically expressed homeobox protein (Hhex) in osteoclast development. Trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 at the cis-regulatory element of Hhex was maintained and that of lysine 4 was reduced during receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis, which was associated with a reduction of Hhex expression. Overexpression of Hhex in bone marrow-derived macrophages inhibited, whereas Hhex suppression promoted, RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Conditional deletion of Hhex in osteoclast-lineage cells promoted osteoclastogenesis and reduced cancellous bone volume in mice, confirming the negative regulatory role of Hhex in osteoclast differentiation. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as Cdkn2a and Cdkn1b in osteoclast precursors was negatively regulated by Hhex, and Hhex deletion increased the ratio of cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In conclusion, Hhex is an inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation that is regulated in an epigenetic manner and regulates the cell cycle of osteoclast precursors and the skeletal homeostasis.

      "Abstract: Upon extensive hepatocyte loss or impaired hepatocyte proliferation, liver regeneration occurs via biliary epithelial cell (BEC) transdifferentiation, which includes dedifferentiation of BECs into bipotential progenitor cells (BP-PCs) and then redifferentiation of BP-PCs to nascent hepatocytes and BECs. This BEC-driven liver regeneration involves reactivation of hepatoblast markers, but the underpinning mechanisms and their effects on liver regeneration remain largely unknown. Using a zebrafish extensive hepatocyte ablation model, we perform an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) forward genetic screen and identify a liver regeneration mutant, liver logan (lvl), in which the telomere maintenance 2 (tel2) gene is mutated. During liver regeneration, the tel2 mutation specifically inhibits transcriptional activation of a hepatoblast marker, hematopoietically expressed homeobox (hhex), in BEC-derived cells, which blocks BP-PC redifferentiation. Mechanistic studies show that Tel2 associates with the hhex promoter region and promotes hhex transcription. Our results reveal roles of Tel2 in the BP-PC redifferentiation process of liver regeneration by activating hhex.\n",

      "Abstract: The deletion of the Hhex (Hematopoietically expressed homeobox) gene causes agenesis of the liver and polycystic liver disease depending on its timing. The present study was undertaken to determine the role of the Hhex gene in not only signaling cascades to cyst and abnormal bile duct formation but also the liver progenitor contribution to cystic development. Liver-specific Hhex knockout mice (Alb-Cre/Hhex(loxP/loxP)) in adult stages were used. Wild-type and conditional knockout (cKO) livers were immunohistologically compared for cell growth, and gene expression of liver functions, biliary markers and cystic markers. In Hhex cKO livers, cyst formation and dilated intrahepatic bile ducts were noted, which resembled the histology of the von Meyenburg complex. Ki67 immunohistochemistry showed that the growth activity in bile ducts and cysts of cKO livers was elevated compared with that of wild-type livers. There were far fewer liver progenitor cells or bile ductule cells around portal veins of cKO livers than in wild-type livers. Several liver-enriched transcription factors, including Foxa1 and Foxa2, were heterogeneously expressed in bile ducts and cysts of cKO livers whereas their expression in wild-type bile ducts was comparatively homogeneous. PC1 and PC2 immunohistochemistry revealed their up-regulation in cysts of cKO livers. These data indicate that Hhex is not only required for proper bile duct morphogenesis, but is also involved in cyst formation through promoted cell growth. Liver progenitor cells may form cysts. Unbalanced expression of liver-enriched transcription factors might be involved in cyst formation. Hhex cKO mice may be a good animal model for hepatic cystic diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The rs7932837 polymorphism in the Hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) gene was discovered through genome-wide association studies and is a promising candidate for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is one of the risk factors for obesity and other complications. T2DM has been identified as a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease characterized by insulin resistance and secretion. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the rs7932837 polymorphism in the HHEX gene in overweight patients diagnosed with T2DM in the Saudi Population. METHODS: In this case-control study, one hundred T2DM cases and 100 controls were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Genotyping was performed with polymerase chair reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and statistical analysis was performed between T2DM cases and controls for clinical characteristics, genotype and allele frequencies and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In this study, T2DM cases were compared with healthy control subjects. Clinical characteristic analysis revealed the statistical analysis between age, weight, BMI, FBG, HDL-c, TC, TG and family history (p < 0.05). HWE analysis was in the accordance (p < 0.05). The rs7932837 polymorphism in the recessive model showed the positive association (AA + AG vs AA: 2.22 [1.25-3.96] & p = 0.006) and none of the genotypes or alleles were in the statistical association. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed positive association with age, BMI and FBG (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study concludes as rs7932837 polymorphism in the HHEX gene showed positive association with recessive model and future studies recommend to carry out with large number of sample size with additional polymorphisms in HHEX gene.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are two deadly diseases caused by the complex interaction of multiple genetic loci, lifestyle and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies described hundreds of susceptibility loci for T2DM and T2DM-related CVD, but it remains uncertain due to geographic and ethnic variations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations of KCNJ11 rs5219, SLC30A8 rs13266634 and HHEX rs1111875 polymorphisms with T2DM and related CVD. METHODS: Genotyping of all three polymorphisms was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method on 250 T2DM cases and 246 healthy controls. Both descriptive and inferential statistical methods were applied using MedCalc and IBM SPSS software programs for statistical analyses. RESULTS: A significantly increased association of KCNJ11 rs5219 (p<0.05) with T2DM was found in dominant, recessive, heterozygote, homozygote, and allele model (aOR = 2.23, 2.03, 1.90, 3.09, and 1.80, respectively). For SLC30A8 rs13266634, only dominant, heterozygote, and allele model (aOR = 3.37, 3.59, and 1.79, respectively) showed significantly increased association with T2DM. SNP rs1111875 (HHEX) also revealed 2.08, 4.18, 5.93, and 2.08-times significant association in dominant, recessive, homozygote, and allele models. Besides, a significantly reduced correlation of KCNJ11 rs5219 was found with T2DM-related CVD in the recessive and allele model (aOR = 0.40 and 0.65, respectively). Again, a significant difference was observed between T2DM-related CVD and non-CVD patients in terms of gender distribution, fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG). CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation indicates that KCNJ11 rs5219, SLC30A8 rs13266634 and HHEX rs1111875 polymorphisms are associated with T2DM. Moreover, KCNJ11 rs5219 polymorphism is correlated with the risk of T2DM-related CVD.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hhex(human hematopoietically expressed homeobox), also known as PRH, is originally considered as a transcription factor to regulate gene expression due to its homebox domain. Increasing studies show that Hhex plays a significant role in development, including anterior-posterior axis formation, vascular development and HSCs self-renewal etc. Hhex is linked to many diseases such as cancers, leukemia, and type-2 diabetes. Although Hhex is reported to inhibit cell migration and invasion of breast and prostate epithelial cells by upregulating Endoglin expression, the effect and molecular mechanism for lung cancer cell motility regulation remains elusive. METHODS: Human non-small cell lung cancer cells and HEK293FT cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of Hhex regulating lung cancer cell migration by using Western blot, immunoprecipitation, wound-healing scratch assay, laser confocal. RESULTS: Our data indicated that Hhex could inhibit cell migration and cell protrusion formation in lung cancer cells. In addition, Hhex inhibited CFL1 phosphorylation to keep its F-actin-severing activity. RHOGDIA was involved in Hhex-induced CFL1 phosphorylation regulation. Hhex enhanced RHOGDIA interaction with RHOA/CDC42, thus maintaining RHOA/CDC42 at an inactive form. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data indicate that Hhex inhibited the activation of RHOA/CDC42 by enhancing interaction of RHOGDIA with RHOA/CDC42, and then RHOA/ CDC42-p-CFL1 signaling pathway was blocked. Consequently, the formation of Filopodium and Lamellipodium on the cell surface was suppressed, and thus the ability of lung cancer cells to migrate was decreased accordingly. Our findings show Hhex plays an important role in regulating migration of lung cancer cells and may provide a potential target for lung cancer therapy. Video abstract.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are over 17,000 patients in the US waiting to receive liver transplants, and these numbers are increasing dramatically. Significant effort is being made to obtain functional hepatocytes and liver tissue that can for therapeutic use in patients. Blastocyst complementation is a challenging, innovative technology that could fundamentally change the future of organ transplantation. It requires the knockout (KO) of genes essential for cell or organ development in early stage host embryos followed by injection of donor pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into host blastocysts to generate chimeric offspring in which progeny of the donor cells populate the open niche to develop functional tissues and organs. METHODS: The HHEX gene is necessary for proper liver development. We engineered loss of HHEX gene expression in early mouse and pig embryos and performed intraspecies blastocyst complementation of HHEX KO embryos with eGFP-labeled PSCs in order to rescue the loss of liver development. RESULTS: Loss of HHEX gene expression resulted in embryonic lethality at day 10.5 in mice and produced characteristics of lethality at day 18 in pigs, with absence of liver tissue in both species. Analyses of mouse and pig HHEX KO fetuses confirmed significant loss of liver-specific gene and protein expression. Intraspecies blastocyst complementation restored liver formation and liver-specific proteins in both mouse and pig. Livers in complemented chimeric fetuses in both species were comprised of eGFP-labeled donor-derived cells and survived beyond the previously observed time of HHEX KO embryonic lethality. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that loss of liver development in the HHEX KO can be rescued via blastocyst complementation in both mice and pigs. This complementation strategy is the first step towards generating interspecies chimeras for the goal of producing human liver cells, tissues, and potentially complete organs for clinical transplantation.\n",

      "Abstract: Obesity is a key health problem and is associated with a high risk of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Increased weight as well as dysregulation of adipocyte homeostasis are the main drivers of obesity. Pathological adipogenesis plays a central role in obesity-related complications such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension and others. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in physiological and pathogenic adipogenesis can help to develop new strategies to prevent or cure obesity and related diseases. Previously, genetic polymorphisms in the HHEX gene that encodes the homeobox transcription factor HEX (PRH) were found to be associated with type 2 diabetes and high body mass index at birth by GWAS in distinct human populations. To understand whether HHEX has a regulatory function in adipogenesis, we performed RNAi-mediated knockdown of Hhex in preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 in vitro, and studied changes in the efficacy of adipogenesis. We found that Hhex knockdown blocks adipogenesis in preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner and leads to a significant decrease of PPAR-gamma protein - the main regulator of adipogenesis. We also propose that Hhex can play an important role in adipocyte differentiation by affecting the level of the PPAR-gamma protein. Our study supports the claim that Hhex plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation program and can contribute to fat tissue homeostasis.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has a high global prevalence, and the interaction of environmental factors and genetic factors may contribute to the risk of T2DM. We aimed to investigate the association between T2DM and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes (CDKAL1 and HHEX) associated with insulin secretion. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: T2DM (n=1,169) and nondiabetic (NDM) (n=1,277) subjects were enrolled and the eight SNPs in CDKAL1 and HHEX genes associated with insulin secretion were genotyped in a Chinese population using MassARRAY. Then, the association of these SNPs with T2DM was analyzed. RESULTS: Our results revealed that four SNPs (rs4712524, rs10946398, rs7754840 in CDKAL1, and rs5015480 in HHEX) showed significantly different distributions between the T2DM and NDM groups (P<0.00625). The G allele of rs4712524 (P=0.004, OR=1.184; 95% CI=1.057-1.327), C allele of rs10946398 (P<0.001, OR=1.247; 95% CI=1.112-1.398), and C allele of rs775480 in CDKAL1 (P<0.001, OR=1.229; 95% CI=1.096-1.387) functioned as risk alleles of T2DM. The C allele of rs5015480 in HHEX (P<0.001, OR=1.295; 95% CI=1.124-1.493) was also the risk factor for T2DM.

CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that genetic variations in CDKAL1 and HHEX were associated with T2DM susceptibility in Chinese population.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Current study aimed to find the association of genes polymorphism of CDKAL1, HHEX, CDKN2A/2B, and IGF2BP2 with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the population of Uttarakhand. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overall 469 persons comprising 369 recently diagnosed T2DM cases and 100 healthy control were enrolled in the present study. The polymorphisms were analyzed through the PCR-RFLP technique. RESULTS: For the rs10440833 variant (CDKAL1), CC genotype's frequency was significantly high among T2DM subjects than controls and increase the T2DM risk (OR: 4.46, 95% CI: 2.22-8.99, p <0.0001). The c allele was significantly found to increase the T2DM risk (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.54-3.14, p <0.001). In the rs1111875 variant (HHEX), the difference of genotype frequencies among T2DM cases and control was statistically non-significant (p-0.138). We did not observe significant differences in allelic frequencies among T2DM cases and control (p-0.444). In the case of rs10811661 variant (CDKN2A/2B), frequency of both TC (OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.84-5.42, p <0.0001) and TT (OR: 5.84, 95% CI: 1.75-19.45, p -0.004) genotype were significantly higher in T2DM cases in comparison with control and significantly associated with higher T2DM risk. Compared to the C allele, a significant increase in T2DM risk was documented with the T allele (OR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.55-3.92, p <0.001). For rs4402960 variant (IGF2BP2), TT genotype contributed to increased T2DM risk (OR: 4.25, 95% CI: 2.02-8.93, p -0.0001). T allele's frequency was significantly high in T2DM cases in comparison with healthy control. Except WHR, HDL-C, exercise, household chores, standing work more than 3 hours, and family history, significant differences were found between T2DM cases and healthy individuals in all other parameters. CONCLUSION: Our study concluded a significant association of CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, and IGF2BP2 polymorphism with T2DM in the Uttarakhand population. For HHEX, the genotype and allelic frequencies difference between T2DM cases and control were statistically non-significant. However, a significant association of HHEX gene polymorphism with T2DM was observed only under the dominant model.\n",

      "Abstract: Aberrant expression of the transcription factor hematopoietic ally expressed homeobox/proline-rich homeodomain (HHEX/PRH) is implicated in numerous cancers. However, the association of HHEX with breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. In this study, HHEX mRNA and protein expression were analyzed using the Oncomine, UALCAN, GEPIA, TCGAportal, and HPA databases. We evaluated the effect of HHEX on clinicopathological parameters using Kaplan-Meier plotter, OncoLnc, TCGAportal, PROGgeneV2, and BC-GenExMiner. Western blotting was performed to compare the level of HHEX in breast samples of Tientsin Albino 2 mice, human breast precancerous lesions, benign breast tumors, and BC. The correlation between HHEX and cancer stem cells was investigated using the GEO (GSE52327 and GSE94865) and GEPIA datasets. Networks between HHEX and survival-related gene marker sets and microRNAs were analyzed using GEPIA, StarBase, and Cytoscape. Results of this study showed that HHEX expression in BC was significantly lower than those in breast precancerous lesions and benign breast tumors at both mRNA and protein levels. BC patients with lower HHEX expression had significantly worse overall survival and disease-free survival. Moreover, HHEX significantly affected the clinicopathology of BC. Specifically, low HHEX expression was correlated with the following groups of patients: age </=51 years, ER-negative or PR-negative patients, HER-2 positive, triple-negative breast cancer, and basal-like BC. Immunohistochemical analysis of the breast samples showed significant differences of HHEX staining index (P < 0.001) among the three groups. To further investigate the mechanism, we determined the intersection of differentially expressed genes related to BC stem cells and those genes after HHEX expression was altered. This led to the identification of four potentially regulated genes-CXL12, BLNK, PAG1, and LPXN. Using StarBase and km-plotter, the negative regulation of HHEX expression and survival trends, including miR-130b, miR-30e, and miR-301b were joined into miRNA-HHEX-mRNA potential regulatory network. The abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion increased in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 breast cancer cell lines after HHEX down expression and decreased after HHEX overexpression compared them in the control cells. In conclusion, these data suggest that HHEX expression is downregulated in BC and HHEX may regulate the development of BC through the stem cell-related genes.\n",

      "Abstract: Hhex encodes a homeobox transcriptional regulator important for embryonic development and hematopoiesis. Hhex is highly expressed in NK cells, and its germline deletion results in significant defects in lymphoid development, including NK cells. To determine if Hhex is intrinsically required throughout NK cell development or for NK cell function, we generate mice that specifically lack Hhex in NK cells. NK cell frequency is dramatically reduced, while NK cell differentiation, IL-15 responsiveness, and function at the cellular level remain largely normal in the absence of Hhex. Increased IL-15 availability fails to fully reverse NK lymphopenia following conditional Hhex deletion, suggesting that Hhex regulates developmental pathways extrinsic to those dependent on IL-15. Gene expression and functional genetic approaches reveal that Hhex regulates NK cell survival by directly binding Bcl2l11 (Bim) and repressing expression of this key apoptotic mediator. These data implicate Hhex as a transcriptional regulator of NK cell homeostasis and immunity.\n",

      "Abstract: NKL homeobox genes encode developmental transcription factors and display an NKL-code according to their physiological expression pattern in hematopoiesis. Here, we analyzed public transcriptome data from primary innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) for NKL homeobox gene activities and found that ILC3 expressed exclusively HHEX while in ILC1 and ILC2 these genes were silenced. Deregulation of the NKL-code promotes hematopoietic malignancies, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) which reportedly may derive from ILC3. Accordingly, we analyzed NKL homeobox gene activities in ALCL cell lines and investigated their role in this malignancy. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated low expression levels of HHEX but powerfully activated HLX. Forced expression of HHEX in ALCL cell lines induced genes involved in apoptosis and ILC3 differentiation, indicating tumor suppressor activity. ALCL associated NPM1-ALK and JAK-STAT3-signalling drove enhanced expression of HLX while discounting HHEX. Genomic profiling revealed copy number gains at the loci of HLX and STAT3 in addition to genes encoding both STAT3 regulators (AURKA, BCL3, JAK3, KPNB1, NAMPT, NFAT5, PIM3, ROCK1, SIX1, TPX2, WWOX) and targets (BATF3, IRF4, miR135b, miR21, RORC). Transcriptome data of ALCL cell lines showed absence of STAT3 mutations while MGA was mutated and downregulated, encoding a novel potential STAT3 repressor. Furthermore, enhanced IL17F-signalling activated HLX while TGFbeta-signalling inhibited HHEX expression. Taken together, our data extend the scope of the NKL-code for ILCs and spotlight aberrant expression of NKL homeobox gene HLX in ALCL. HLX represents a direct target of ALCL hallmark factor STAT3 and deregulates cell survival and differentiation in this malignancy.\n",

      "Abstract: Memory B cells (MBCs) are essential for long-lived humoral immunity. However, the transcription factors involved in MBC differentiation are poorly defined. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we identified a population of germinal center (GC) B cells in the process of differentiating into MBCs. Using an inducible CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach, we identified the hematopoietically expressed homeobox protein Hhex as a transcription factor regulating MBC differentiation. The corepressor Tle3 was also identified in the screen and was found to interact with Hhex to promote MBC development. Bcl-6 directly repressed Hhex in GC B cells. Reciprocally, Hhex-deficient MBCs exhibited increased Bcl6 expression and reduced expression of the Bcl-6 target gene Bcl2. Overexpression of Bcl-2 was able to rescue MBC differentiation in Hhex-deficient cells. We also identified Ski as an Hhex-induced transcription factor involved in MBC differentiation. These findings establish an important role for Hhex-Tle3 in regulating the transcriptional circuitry governing MBC differentiation.\n",

      "Abstract: Additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), an epigenetic modulator, is frequently mutated in myeloid neoplasms. Recent analyses of mutant ASXL1 conditional knockin (ASXL1-MT-KI) mice suggested that ASXL1-MT alone is insufficient for myeloid transformation. In our previous study, we used retrovirus-mediated insertional mutagenesis, which exhibited the susceptibility of ASXL1-MT-KI hematopoietic cells to transform into myeloid leukemia cells. In this screening, we identified the hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) gene as one of the common retrovirus integration sites. In this study, we investigated the potential cooperation between ASXL1-MT and HHEX in myeloid leukemogenesis. Expression of HHEX enhanced proliferation of ASXL1-MT-expressing HSPCs by inhibiting apoptosis and blocking differentiation, whereas it showed only modest effect in normal HSPCs. Moreover, ASXL1-MT and HHEX accelerated the development of RUNX1-ETO9a and FLT3-ITD leukemia. Conversely, HHEX depletion profoundly attenuated the colony-forming activity and leukemogenicity of ASXL1-MT-expressing leukemia cells. Mechanistically, we identified MYB and ETV5 as downstream targets for ASXL1-MT and HHEX by using transcriptome and chromatin immunoprecipitation-next-generation sequencing analyses. Moreover, we found that expression of ASXL1-MT enhanced the binding of HHEX to the promoter loci of MYB or ETV5 via reducing H2AK119ub. Depletion of MYB or ETV5 induced apoptosis or differentiation in ASXL1-MT-expressing leukemia cells, respectively. In addition, ectopic expression of MYB or ETV5 reversed the reduced colony-forming activity of HHEX-depleted ASXL1-MT-expressing leukemia cells. These findings indicate that the HHEX-MYB/ETV5 axis promotes myeloid transformation in ASXL1-mutated preleukemia cells.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the rs5015480 single-nucleotide polymorphism of hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) via meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was performed of the PubMed, Springer, Science Direct, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and VIP databases for studies worldwide on the relationship between HHEX rs5015480 and GDM published up to July 2019. Rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed, and the quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, followed by heterogeneity evaluation using the Q test and I statistic and data pooling. A meta-analysis was then performed on the included studies using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: A total of 4 eligible case-control studies were included, involving a total of 1651 patients and 3513 controls. The meta-analysis showed the following odds ratios: C allele vs T allele, 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.38); CC genotype vs TT genotype, 1.65 (95% CI: 1.26-2.17); CC genotype vs CT genotype, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.00-1.50); and CC genotype vs CT + TT genotype, 1.32 (95% CI: 1.09-1.61). CONCLUSIONS: HHEX rs5015480 represents a risk factor for the development of GDM, and pregnant women carrying the CC genotype have an increased risk of GDM.\n",

      "Abstract: The transcription factor Hhex (hematopoietically expressed homeobox gene) is critical for development of multiple lymphoid lineages beyond the common lymphoid progenitor. In addition, Hhex regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, emergency hematopoiesis, and acute myeloid leukemia initiation and maintenance. Hhex mediates its effects on HSCs and acute myeloid leukemia stem cells via repression of the Cdkn2a tumor suppressor locus. However, we report here that loss of Cdkn2a does not rescue the failure of lymphoid development caused by loss of Hhex. As loss of Hhex causes apoptosis of lymphoid progenitors associated with impaired Bcl2 expression and defective Stat5b signaling, we tested the effects of rescuing these pathways using transgenic mice. Expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl2, but not activated Stat5, rescued the development of T-, B-, and NK-cell lineages in the absence of Hhex. These results indicate that Bcl2 expression, but not Stat5b signaling or loss of Cdkn2a, can overcome the lymphoid deficiencies caused by the absence of Hhex, suggesting that the primary role of this transcription factor is to promote survival of lymphoid progenitors during early lymphoid development.\n",

      "Abstract: Cancer cells go through a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during which they acquire the ability to migrate and invade extracellular matrix. Some cells also acquire the ability to move across a layer of endothelial cells to enter and exit the bloodstream; intra- and extravasation, respectively. The transcription factor PRH/HHEX (proline-rich homeodomain/haematopoietically expressed homeobox) controls cell proliferation and cell migration/invasion in a range of cell types. Our previous work showed that PRH activity is downregulated in prostate cancer cells owing to increased inhibitory PRH phosphorylation and that this increases cell proliferation and invasion. PRH inhibits migration and invasion by prostate and breast epithelial cells in part by activating the transcription of Endoglin, a transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) co-receptor. Here we show that depletion of PRH in immortalised prostate epithelial cells results in increased extravasation in vitro. We show that blood platelets stimulate extravasation of cells with depleted PRH and that inhibition of TGFbeta signalling blocks the effects of platelets on these cells. Moreover, TGFbeta induces changes characteristic of EMT including decreased E-Cadherin expression and increased Snail expression. We show that in prostate cells PRH regulates multiple genes involved in EMT and TGFbeta signalling. However, both platelets and TGFbeta increase PRH phosphorylation. In addition, TGFbeta increases binding of its effector pSMAD3 to the PRH/HHEX promoter and downregulates PRH protein and mRNA levels. Thus, TGFbeta signalling downregulates PRH activity by multiple mechanisms and induces an EMT that facilitates extravasation and sensitises cells to TGFbeta.\n",

      "Abstract: Aberrant Notch and Wnt signaling are known drivers of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), but the underlying factors that initiate and maintain these pathways are not known. Here, we show that the proline-rich homeodomain protein/hematopoietically expressed homeobox (PRH/HHEX) transcription factor forms a positive transcriptional feedback loop with Notch3 that is critical in CCA. PRH/HHEX expression is elevated in CCA, and depletion of PRH reduces CCA tumor growth in a xenograft model. Overexpression of PRH in primary human biliary epithelial cells is sufficient to increase cell proliferation and produce an invasive phenotype. Interrogation of the gene networks regulated by PRH and Notch3 reveals that unlike Notch3, PRH directly activates canonical Wnt signaling. These data indicate that hyperactivation of Notch and Wnt signaling is independent of the underlying mutational landscape and has a common origin in dysregulation of PRH. Moreover, they suggest new therapeutic options based on the dependence of specific Wnt, Notch, and CDK4/6 inhibitors on PRH activity. SIGNIFICANCE: The PRH/HHEX transcription factor is an oncogenic driver in cholangiocarcinoma that confers sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors.\n",

      "Abstract: Regulatory T (Treg) cells play an essential role in maintaining immune homeostasis, but the suppressive function of Treg cells can be an obstacle in the treatment of cancer and chronic infectious diseases. Here, we identified the homeobox protein Hhex as a negative regulator of Treg cells. The expression of Hhex was lower in Treg cells than in conventional T (Tconv) cells. Hhex expression was repressed in Treg cells by TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling. Retroviral overexpression of Hhex inhibited the differentiation of induced Treg (iTreg) cells and the stability of thymic Treg (tTreg) cells by significantly reducing Foxp3 expression. Moreover, Hhex-overexpressing Treg cells lost their immunosuppressive activity and failed to prevent colitis in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Hhex expression was increased; however, Foxp3 expression was decreased in Treg cells in a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, a type I immune reaction. Hhex directly bound to the promoters of Foxp3 and other Treg signature genes, including Il2ra and Ctla4, and repressed their transactivation. The homeodomain and N-terminal repression domain of Hhex were critical for inhibiting Foxp3 and other Treg signature genes. Thus, Hhex plays an essential role in inhibiting Treg cell differentiation and function via inhibition of Foxp3.\n",

      "Abstract: Significant efforts have advanced our understanding of foregut-derived organ development; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of the hepatopancreatic ductal (HPD) system. Here, we report a role for the homeodomain transcription factor Hhex in directing HPD progenitor specification in zebrafish. Loss of Hhex function results in impaired HPD system formation. We found that Hhex specifies a distinct population of HPD progenitors that gives rise to the cystic duct, common bile duct, and extra-pancreatic duct. Since hhex is not uniquely expressed in the HPD region but is also expressed in endothelial cells and the yolk syncytial layer (YSL), we tested the role of blood vessels as well as the YSL in HPD formation. We found that blood vessels are required for HPD patterning, but not for HPD progenitor specification. In addition, we found that Hhex is required in both the endoderm and the YSL for HPD development. Our results shed light on the mechanisms directing endodermal progenitors towards the HPD fate and emphasize the tissue specific requirement of Hhex during development.\n",

The rs1111875G/A, rs7923837A/G, and rs5015480C/T HHEX gene polymorphisms were genotyped in 250 cases and 250 matched (age and sex) healthy controls using tetra-amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method. The finding revealed the all measured inheritance models of rs1111875G/A and of rs5015480C/T variants dramatically increase the risk of T2D while another polymorphism (rs7923837A/G) was not associated with risk/protective role in T2D. The results indicated that rs1111875G/A and rs5015480C/T may contribute to the enhancement of T2D risk in a sample of the southeast Iranian population.\n",

      "Abstract: The hepatopancreatic duct (HPD) system links the liver and pancreas to the intestinal tube and is composed of the extrahepatic biliary duct, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. Haematopoietically expressed-homeobox (Hhex) protein plays an essential role in the establishment of HPD; however, the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that zebrafish hhex-null mutants fail to develop the HPD system characterized by lacking the biliary marker Annexin A4 and the HPD marker sox9b. The hepatobiliary duct part of the mutant HPD system is replaced by an intrahepatic intestinal tube characterized by expressing the intestinal marker fatty acid-binding protein 2a (fabp2a). Cell lineage analysis showed that this intrahepatic intestinal tube is not originated from hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. Further analysis revealed that cdx1b and pdx1 are expressed ectopically in the intrahepatic intestinal tube and knockdown of cdx1b and pdx1 could restore the expression of sox9b in the mutant. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Hhex binds to the promoters of pdx1 and cdx1b genes to repress their expression. We therefore propose that Hhex, Cdx1b, Pdx1, and Sox9b form a genetic network governing the patterning and morphogenesis of the HPD and digestive tract systems in zebrafish.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since alcohol intake increases the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in Koreans, we tested the hypothesis that the interactions of genetic variants involved in beta-cell function and mass with alcohol intake increase the T2DM risk. METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by genome-wide association study for insulin secretion after adjusting for age, gender, area of residence, body mass index, and alcohol intake (p < 1 x 10(-4) ) in 8,842 middle-aged adults in the Ansan/Ansung cohort. Genetic risk scores (GRSs) were calculated by summing the risk alleles of 4 selected SNPs, CDKAL1 rs7754840 and rs9460546, HHEX rs5015480, and OAS3 rs2072134. The GRSs were categorized into 3 groups by tertiles, and the association between GRS and insulin secretion was measured using logistic regression after adjusting for confounding factors in the Ansan/Ansung cohort. The results were confirmed by the Rural cohort. RESULTS: HOMA-IR was higher and HOMA-B was much lower in the High-GRS than the Low-GRS in both cohorts. T2DM risk was higher by approximately 1.5-fold in the High-GRS than in the Low-GRS in both cohorts. In the High-GRS group, HOMA-B decreased by 0.89- and 0.62-fold in comparison with the Low-GRS in the Ansan/Ansung cohort and Rural cohort. The GRS interacted with alcohol intake to increase the risk of developing T2DM in the Ansan/Ansung cohort (p = 0.036) and Rural cohort (p = 0.071). The risk of T2DM increased in the High-GRS group with high alcohol intake and it was associated with decreased HOMA-B. High alcohol intake decreased HOMA-B regardless of GRS, and HOMA-B was lower in the descending order of Medium-GRS, Low-GRS, and High-GRS. However, HOMA-IR was not altered by alcohol intake, but was elevated in the High-GRS more than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with a High-GRS had an elevated risk of T2DM even with moderate alcohol intakes due to lower HOMA-B. High alcohol intake appears to be a risk factor for all Asians regardless of alcohol intake.\n",

      "Abstract: Formation of the lymphatic system requires the coordinated expression of several key regulators: vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), its receptor FLT4, and a key transcriptional effector, PROX1. Yet, how expression of these signaling components is regulated remains poorly understood. Here, using a combination of genetic and molecular approaches, we identify the transcription factor hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) as an upstream regulator of VEGFC, FLT4, and PROX1 during angiogenic sprouting and lymphatic formation in vertebrates. By analyzing zebrafish mutants, we found that hhex is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis from the posterior cardinal vein, a process required for lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, studies of mammalian HHEX using tissue-specific genetic deletions in mouse and knockdowns in cultured human endothelial cells reveal its highly conserved function during vascular and lymphatic development. Our findings that HHEX is essential for the regulation of the VEGFC/FLT4/PROX1 axis provide insights into the molecular regulation of lymphangiogenesis.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility loci identified via genome-wide association studies were found to be replicated among various populations. However, the influence of these loci on T2D in Thai population is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in GWA studies on T2D and related quantitative traits in Thai population. METHODS: Eight SNPs in or near the KCNQ1, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, HHEX, CDKAL1, TCF7L2, MTNR1B, and UBE2E2 genes were genotyped. A case-control association study comprising 500 Thai patients with T2D and 500 ethnically-matched control subjects was conducted. Associations between SNPs and T2D were examined by logistic regression analysis. The impact of these SNPs on quantitative traits was examined by linear regression among case and control subjects. RESULTS: Five SNPs in KCNQ1 (rs2237892), CDK2A/2B (rs108116610, SLC30A8 (rs13266634), TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and MTNR1B (rs1387153) were found to be marginally associated with risk of developing T2D, with odds ratios ranging from 1.43 to 2.02 (p = 0.047 to 3.0 x 10-4) with adjustments for age, sex, and body mass index. Interestingly, SNP rs13266634 of SLC30A8 gene reached statistical significance after correcting for multiple testing (p = 0.0003) (p < 0.006 after Bonferroni correction). However, no significant association was detected between HHEX (rs1111875), CDKAL1 (rs7756992), or UBE2E2 (rs7612463) and T2D. We also observed association between rs10811661 and both waist circumference and waist-hip ratio (p = 0.007 and p = 0.023, respectively). In addition, rs13266634 in SLC30A8 was associated with glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.018), and rs7903146 in TCF7L2 was associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: Of the eight genes included in our analysis, significant association was observed between KCNQ1, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, and MTNR1B loci and T2D in our Thai study population. Of these, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2 genes were also significantly associated with anthropometric, glycemic and lipid characteristics. Larger cohort studies and meta-analyses are needed to further confirm the effect of these variants in Thai population.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for serum fasting glucose levels have reported HHEX as possibly causal. The objective of this study was to examine the joint effect of smoking on the association of diabetes with the HHEX rs5015480 polymorphism among Korean subjects. METHODS: This replication study included a total of 4240 individuals, and multivariate linear regression and multiple logistic regression models were used. We examined the combined effect of smoking on the relationship between HHEX rs5015480 and diabetes. RESULTS: The rs5015480 SNP in the HHEX gene was related to the mean FBS level (effect per allele, 1.572 mg/dL, p = 0.0122). Females with the CC genotype had a 2.68 times higher (range, 1.05-6.82 times) risk of diabetes than those with the TT/TC genotype. Although the association was stronger in female subjects (OR, 4.46; 95% CI, 1.15-17.3, p = 0.0304) among healthy individuals (N = 2461), the association between HHEX and diabetes was much stronger in male heavy smokers (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.19-13.6, p = 0.0247) than in nonsmokers (p = 0.9709) and ex-smokers (p = 0.2399). The interaction of smoking was also statistically significant (P for interaction =0.0182). CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly demonstrates that a genetic variant in HHEX influences fasting glucose levels in Korean women and male heavy smokers.\n",

      "Abstract: The hematopoietically expressed homeobox (Hhex) transcription factor is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemias. Conditional knockout models of murine acute myeloid leukemia indicate that Hhex maintains leukemia stem cell self-renewal by enabling Polycomb-mediated epigenetic repression of the Cdkn2a tumor suppressor locus, encoding p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) However, whether Hhex overexpression also affects hematopoietic differentiation is unknown. To study this, we retrovirally overexpressed Hhex in hematopoietic progenitors. This enabled serial replating of myeloid progenitors, leading to the rapid establishment of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent promyelocytic cell lines. Use of a Hhex-ERT2 fusion protein demonstrated that continuous nuclear Hhex is required for transformation, and structure function analysis demonstrated a requirement of the DNA-binding and N-terminal-repressive domains of Hhex for promyelocytic transformation. This included the N-terminal promyelocytic leukemia protein (Pml) interaction domain, although deletion of Pml failed to prevent Hhex-induced promyelocyte transformation, implying other critical partners. Furthermore, deletion of p16(Ink4a) or p19(Arf) did not promote promyelocyte transformation, indicating that repression of distinct Hhex target genes is required for this process. Indeed, transcriptome analysis showed that Hhex overexpression resulted in repression of several myeloid developmental genes. To test the potential for Hhex overexpression to contribute to leukemic transformation, Hhex-transformed promyelocyte lines were rendered growth factor-independent using a constitutively active IL-3 receptor common beta subunit (betacV449E). The resultant cell lines resulted in a rapid promyelocytic leukemia in vivo. Thus, Hhex overexpression can contribute to myeloid leukemia via multiple mechanisms including differentiation blockade and enabling epigenetic repression of the Cdkn2a locus.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The hematopoietically expressed homeobox (HHEX) is widely expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and is an essential transcription factor in embryonic development; however its role in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis is poorly understood. We are thus exploring the association of HHEX and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The study included 56 AML patients and 12 normal bone marrows (NBMs). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) was used to assess HHEX expression. The functional consequences of this gene were explored in the Kasumi-1 cell-line following dampened expression of HHEX. This was done by transfecting small interfering RNA (siRNA). RESULTS: Expression levels of HHEX in AML were similar to that found in controls (0.094+/-0.103 vs. 0.078+/-0.112; p=0.203), but AML with t(8;21) was more prevalent than other types of AMLs (p<0.01) or controls (p<0.05). Expression levels of HHEX in AML (non-M3) did not significantly affect overall survival (p=0.555). In vitro studies carried out in Kasumi-1 cells suggest that after decreasing HHEX, cell viability at 48 and 72 h were significantly reduced compared to controls (p<0.05). The apoptotic rate was also significantly increased at 48 and 72 h compared to controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HHEX is expressed in multiple types of AML, with the highest levels seen in t(8;21) AML. HHEX was essential for Kasumi-1 cell proliferation and may represent a potential therapeutic target enabling against AML.\n",

      "Abstract: Breast tumours progress from hyperplasia to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast carcinoma (IBC). PRH/HHEX (proline-rich homeodomain/haematopoietically expressed homeobox) is a transcription factor that displays both tumour suppressor and oncogenic activity in different disease contexts; however, the role of PRH in breast cancer is poorly understood. Here we show that nuclear localization of the PRH protein is decreased in DCIS and IBC compared with normal breast. Our previous work has shown that PRH phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 prevents PRH from binding to DNA and regulating the transcription of multiple genes encoding growth factors and growth factor receptors. Here we show that transcriptionally inactive phosphorylated PRH is elevated in DCIS and IBC compared with normal breast. To determine the consequences of PRH loss of function in breast cancer cells, we generated inducible PRH depletion in MCF-7 cells. We show that PRH depletion results in increased MCF-7 cell proliferation in part at least due to increased vascular endothelial growth factor signalling. Moreover, we demonstrate that PRH depletion increases the formation of breast cancer cells with cancer stem cell-like properties. Finally, and in keeping with these findings, we show that PRH overexpression inhibits the growth of mammary tumours in mice. Collectively, these data indicate that PRH plays a tumour suppressive role in the breast and they provide an explanation for the finding that low PRH mRNA levels are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer.\n",

      "Abstract: The hematopoietically expressed homeobox transcription factor (Hhex) is important for the maturation of definitive hematopoietic progenitors and B-cells during development. We have recently shown that in adult hematopoiesis, Hhex is dispensable for maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid lineages but essential for the commitment of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) to lymphoid lineages. Here, we show that during serial bone marrow transplantation, Hhex-deleted HSCs are progressively lost, revealing an intrinsic defect in HSC self-renewal. Moreover, Hhex-deleted mice show markedly impaired hematopoietic recovery following myeloablation, due to a failure of progenitor expansion. In vitro, Hhex-null blast colonies were incapable of replating, implying a specific requirement for Hhex in immature progenitors. Transcriptome analysis of Hhex-null Lin(-) Sca(+) Kit(+) cells showed that Hhex deletion leads to derepression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and PRC1 target genes, including the Cdkn2a locus encoding the tumor suppressors p16(Ink) 4(a) and p19(Arf) . Indeed, loss of Cdkn2a restored the capacity of Hhex-null blast colonies to generate myeloid progenitors in vitro, as well as hematopoietic reconstitution following myeloablation in vivo. Thus, HSCs require Hhex to promote PRC2-mediated Cdkn2a repression to enable continued self-renewal and response to hematopoietic stress. Stem Cells 2017;35:1948-1957.\n",

      "Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) emerge during development via an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition from hemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta (DA). Using in situ hybridization and analysis of a knock-in RedStar reporter, we show that the transcriptional regulator Hhex is expressed in endothelium of the dorsal aorta (DA) and in clusters of putative HSCs as they are specified during murine development. We exploited this observation, using the Hhex locus to define cis regulatory elements, enhancers and interacting transcription factors that are both necessary and sufficient to support gene expression in the emerging HSC. We identify an evolutionarily conserved non-coding region (ECR) in the Hhex locus with the capacity to bind the hematopoietic-affiliated transcriptional regulators Gata2, SCL, Fli1, Pu.1 and Ets1/2. This region is sufficient to drive the expression of a transgenic GFP reporter in the DA endothelium and intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters. GFP-positive AGM cells co-expressed HSC-associated markers c-Kit, CD34, VE-Cadherin, and CD45, and were capable of multipotential differentiation and long term engraftment when transplanted into myelo-ablated recipients. The Hhex ECR was also sufficient to drive expression at additional blood sites including the yolk sac blood islands, fetal liver, vitelline and umbilical arteries and the adult bone marrow, suggesting a common mechanism for Hhex regulation throughout ontogenesis of the blood system. To explore the physiological requirement for the Hhex ECR region during hematoendothelial development, we deleted the ECR element from the endogenous locus in the context of a targeted Hhex-RedStar reporter allele. Results indicate a specific requirement for the ECR in blood-associated Hhex expression during development and further demonstrate a requirement for this region in the adult HSC compartment. Taken together, our results identified the ECR region as an enhancer both necessary and sufficient for gene expression in HSC development and homeostasis. The Hhex ECR thus appears to be a core node for the convergence of the transcription factor network that governs the emergence of HSCs.\n",
