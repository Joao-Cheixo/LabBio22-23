      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimum prophylactic regimen against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) in HBV-infected patients is uncertain but of great clinical relevance. New evidence suggests that hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG)-free approach would become a reasonable choice in the era of high-potency nucleos(t)ide analogues (HPNAs). We aimed to provide robust estimates for long-term survival and HBV recurrence in patients receiving different HBV-prophylaxis strategies after LT. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis using both pseudo-individual patient data recovered from included studies (IPDMA) and conventional trial-level aggregate data meta-analysis (ADMA). Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using different Cox proportional hazard models accounting for inter-study heterogeneity. ADMA was conducted to pool outcomes at specific time points. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies involving 7897 patients and 41 studies involving 9435 were eligible for IPDMA and AMDA, respectively. Cumulative HBV recurrence rate and overall survival (OS) at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years post-LT were 0.3%, 0.9%, 1.2%, 1.7% and 95.6%, 89%, 86.4%, 86.4% in the HPNAs (i.e., entecavir and tenofovir) + HBIG combination group vs. 0.6%, 0.6%, 1.2%, 1.7% and 94.5%, 86.8%, 84.8%, 81.2% in the HPNAs monotherapy group (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.56-2.60, p = 0.64; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.70-1.69, p = 0.72), respectively. The results were compatible with AMDA. CONCLUSION: A similar HBV recurrence and overall survival were found in patients who used HPNAs (mainly entecavir) monotherapy as in those who received a combination of HPNAs and HBIG. These findings address concerns regarding the safety and effectiveness of HPNAs monotherapy.\n",

      "Abstract: This study aimed to explore the effects of the 3 nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) on lipid levels. We retrospectively included patients treated with NAs at 2 centers and collected their clinical data at their visiting points. Differences in blood lipid levels were analyzed by statistical methods, and factors related to hyperlipidemia were discussed. In these 2 centers, the prevalence rates of hypercholesterolemia were 12/181 (6.6%) for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF)-, 0/158 (0%) for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-, and 13/182 (7.1%) for entecavir (ETV)-treated individuals (P = .003). The prevalence rates of hypertriglyceridemia were 30/181 (16.6%) for TAF-, 11/158 (7.0%) for TDF-, and 26/182 (14.3%) for ETV-treated individuals (P = .025). In TAF (n = 181, 10 [6, 15] months), TDF (n = 158, 18 [7.5, 45] months), and ETV (n = 182, 24 [10, 60] months) groups, total cholesterol (TC) levels were 4.63 +/- 0.91 mmol/L, 3.86 +/- 0.61 mmol/L, and 4.53 +/- 0.87 mmol/L, respectively; triglyceride (TG) levels were 1.27 +/- 0.76 mmol/L, 0.87 +/- 0.51 mmol/L, and 1.14 +/- 0.67 mmol/L, respectively (P < .001). In multivariate regression analysis, factors associated with hypercholesterolemia were age (adjusted hazard risk [HR] = 1.055 [1.018-1.094]; P = .003) and body mass index (BMI) (adjusted HR = 0.817 [0.669-0.998]; P = .048). Factors associated with hypertriglyceridemia were TAF group (vs. TDF group) (adjusted HR = 0.405 [0.167-0.980]; P = .045), age (adjusted HR = 1.028 [1.002-1.055]; P = .038), and sex (adjusted HR = 0.190 [0.079-0.456]; P < .001). Among the patients treated with TAF (10 [6, 15] months), TDF (18 [7.5, 45] months), and ETV (24 [10, 60] months), the blood lipid levels in the TDF group were lower than those in the TAF group and ETV group, and the occurrence of hyperlipidemia was associated with age, sex, BMI, and different treatment.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B is usually treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). However, a cure is rarely achieved even with years of treatment. Here, we investigated whether viral replication is completely halted and how long covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) persists in NAs successfully treated patients. METHODS: A series of longitudinal serum samples and a collection of cross-sectional liver biopsies were obtained from NAs successfully treated patients. Viral variants in serum HBV RNA were enumerated by deep sequencing. Viral replication intermediates in hepatocytes were directly visualized by in situ hybridization. The apparent half-life of each cccDNA was estimated. RESULTS: Three out of six successfully treated patients demonstrated clear evidence of a small proportion of virus evolution, although the overwhelming variants were identical or possessed a similar degree of divergence through time. The apparent half-life of variants was estimated from approximately 7.42 weeks to infinite. Moreover, hepatocytes remained positive for cytoplasmic nucleocapsids-associated relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) in four out of seven liver needle biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore conclude that even after prolonged treatment, a small proportion of the cccDNA reservoir is constantly replenished by continued low-level HBV replication, whereas the greatest amount of cccDNA reservoir persists over time.\n",

      "Abstract: Noninvasive methods for assessing hepatic fibrosis are clinically necessary. This study aims to explore HBV markers correlated with liver fibrosis and capable of diagnosing significant fibrosis and predicting fibrosis regression. Seventy-four HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were enrolled and started on entecavir or adefovir therapy. Serum HBV RNA, HBV DNA, HBsAg and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) levels were measured at baseline and during treatment. Liver fibrosis was assessed at baseline and month 60 by liver biopsy. Fibrosis regression was defined as Ishak fibrosis score decreased >/= 1-point. At baseline, HBsAg, HBcrAg, and HBV RNA levels had a stronger correlation with Ishak fibrosis score (r=-0.441, P=0.002; r=-0.469, P=0.001; r=-0.398, P=0.001) than APRI and FIB-4 (r=0.321 P=0.006; r=0.371, P=0.001). HBsAg >4 log(10) IU/mL plus HBcrAg >7 log(10) IU/mL or HBsAg >4 log(10) IU/mL plus HBV RNA>5 log(10) copies/ml exhibited the same excellent diagnostic ability for significant fibrosis with the an AUROC of 0.857. After 60 months of antiviral treatment, 66.7% of patients who suffered had fibrosis at baseline achieved fibrosis regression. And, an HBV RNA decline from baseline to month 6 greater than 0.63 log(10) copies /mL could predict the fibrosis regression at month 60. In conclusion, serum HBsAg, HBcrAg and HBV RNA are potential markers for predicting significant liver fibrosis. HBV RNA measurement would be particularly useful for monitoring hepatic fibrosis changes in HBeAg-positive CHB patients.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Serum HBV RNA has been considered a potential biomarker in monitoring the prognosis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, Real-life cohort studies on the profile of HBV RNA in chronic HBV infected patients during first-line nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) are lacking. We aimed to investigate HBV RNA dynamic pattern and clinical value chronic HBV infected patients under NA therapy. METHODS: HBV RNA and clinical assessments were measured in 82 treatment-naive chronic HBV infected patients. These enrolled patients were categorized into HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infected (n = 53) and HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infected (n = 29). Of these, there were 59, 46, and 30 chronic HBV infected patients completed the follow-up clinical assessments at 12, 24, and 48 weeks of NAs therapy, respectively. RESULTS: In treatment-naive patients, there was a positive correlation between HBV RNA and HBV DNA, HBsAg (r = 0.602 and 0.502. P < 0.05). The median level of HBV DNA was higher than HBV RNA by 1.64 log(10) copies/mL(.) The mean level of serum HBV RNA was 4.62 (IQR: 3.05-5.82) log(10) copies/mL at baseline, and the median level of HBV RNA was 2.88 (IQR: 0-4.67), 2.71 (IQR: 0-4.22), and 2.96 (IQR: 0-4.32) log(10) copies/mL at week 12, 24, and 48, respectively. HBV RNA showed a positive linear correlation with HBV DNA at 12, 24, and 48 weeks of NA treatment (r = 0.640, 0.715, and 0.656 respectively, P < 0.05). In patients who were treated 48 weeks NAs, 67% had quantifiable HBV RNA while only 37% had quantifiable HBV DNA. CONCLUSION: HBV RNA has signature profiles in different stages of chronic HBV infected patients receiving first-line NAs. During antiviral treatment, HBV RNA can still monitor the virus activity in patients whose serum HBV DNA cannot be detected.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: The risk of serious clinical outcomes following cessation of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) in individuals with chronic hepatitis B remains poorly characterized. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current literature on this issue. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for NUC stop studies that noted clinical outcomes published between January 1, 2006 and August 18, 2022. We performed meta-research analyses to examine the relationships of reported outcomes with study designs and characteristics and also pooled studies with non-overlapping populations to provide risk estimates for the proportions of (1) severe hepatitis flares or hepatic decompensation or (2) hepatitis flare-related death or liver transplantation. RESULTS: The meta-research analysis included 50 studies of highly heterogeneous designs and characteristics. We found that reporting of safety outcomes varied widely according to outcome definition, follow-up duration, and sample size. Only ten studies prespecified safety events as the study outcome, and only four had an outcome definition to include hepatic insufficiency, a follow-up duration >12 months, and a sample size >100 patients. We further pooled 15 studies with 4,525 individuals and estimated that severe hepatitis flares or decompensation would occur in 1.21% (95% CI 0.70-2.08%), with significant heterogeneity (I (2) = 54%, p <0.01), while hepatitis flare-related death or liver transplantation would occur in 0.37% (95% CI 0.20-0.67%), without significant heterogeneity (I (2) = 0.00%, p = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Current literature on the risk of serious clinical outcomes following NUC cessation is very limited and highly heterogeneous. Pooled analyses of available data found approximately 1% of patients who stopped NUCs developed severe flares or hepatic decompensation. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Current literature regarding the safety concerns surrounding NUC cessation for individuals with chronic hepatitis B is limited and heterogeneous in designs and characteristics, and thus should be interpreted with great caution. Based on currently available data, the proportion of patients that develop severe hepatitis flares or hepatic decompensation was estimated at 1.21% and that of flare-related death or liver transplantation at 0.37%. Our findings are important for individuals receiving nucleos(t)ide analogues for hepatitis B virus infection because we not only pooled currently available data to estimate the risk of serious clinical adverse events following treatment cessation but also uncovered critical limitations of existing literature regarding the safety of finite therapy.\n",

      "Abstract: AIM: We retrospectively investigated patients with administration of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) for prevention of or against hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, and their clinical outcomes after cessation of the NA. METHODS: We enrolled 180 patients who were positive for HBsAg when they started immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy and an NA was administered to prevent HBV reactivation (HBV carrier group), and 82 patients with resolved HBV infection who started administration of an NA after HBV reactivation (de novo HBV group). Cessation of the NA depended on each physician's judgment without definite criteria. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients in the HBV carrier group and 22 in the de novo HBV group stopped NA therapy. In the HBV carrier group, 16 patients experienced virological relapse, which was defined as HBV DNA levels >/=20 IU/ml, and one with hematological disease had an alanine aminotransferase flare after cessation of NA. Of the 16 patients, the NA was reintroduced in three, whereas, the remaining 13 had low levels of HBV DNA and no alanine aminotransferase flare. In the de novo HBV group, virological relapse occurred in six patients, and one with hematological disease had an alanine aminotransferase flare after cessation of the NA. The NA was reintroduced in four of the six patients. CONCLUSIONS: We may be able to consider to cease NA therapy proactively in HBV carriers and resolved patients with non-hematological disease, if their primary diseases are under remission after completion of immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy. However, careful follow up is necessary after stopping NA therapy.\n",

      "Abstract: In cyprinids, Tyrode's (TLP) and Volckaert's (VRT) solutions are the most frequently used extenders for short-term sperm storage. The effectiveness of TLP and VRT on ide (Leuciscus idus) sperm short-term storage was analyzed using a x 4 (sperm:extender) dilution ratio over 48 h. A x 4 (1:3) dilution ratio was compared to a x 10 (1:9) dilution ratio for ide sperm storage using TLP supplemented with antibiotics and was tested for a 14-day period. Sperm motility (MOT, %), progressively motile sperm (PRG, %), curvilinear velocity of sperm (VCL, microm s(-1)), movement linearity (LIN, %), beat cross frequency (BCF, Hz), and the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, microm) were verified using a CASA system. After 48 h, most CASA parameters were significantly higher in TLP compared to VRT. The dilution ratio also had a significant impact (P < 0.0001) on the efficiency of ide sperm short-term storage over 14 d in comparison to undiluted sperm (control). Ide sperm diluted with TLP supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and stored short term, regardless of the dilution ratio used, retained motility and fertilization capacity over 14 d at 4  degrees C. The highest embryo survival rates of 70% and 73% were noted using sperm diluted with TLP at x 4 and x 10 dilution ratios compared to 48% for raw sperm that was not stored short term.\n",

DESIGN: Single group, repeated measures feasibility study. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: Adults experiencing LBP of any kind and self-reporting consumption of paracetamol for LBP weekly for at least 1 month were invited to participate. INTERVENTION: Participants received a patient-education booklet 1 week after the baseline measures were collected. The intervention was designed to change beliefs, increase knowledge and self-efficacy to deprescribe paracetamol for their LBP and create discussion with a health professional through the mechanisms of motivation, capacity and opportunity. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility of recruitment procedures, data collection and acceptability of the intervention. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in motivation, self-efficacy, opportunity to deprescribe paracetamol for their LBP, paracetamol usage and LBP clinical outcomes at baseline, 1-week and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 24 participants were recruited into the study within the timeframe of 3 months from study advertisement and all completed the study follow-up. There were no missing data for any outcome measure across all follow-up points, 22 (91.6%) participants were willing to participate in a future randomised control trial (RCT) and over 60% of participants responded positively to questions regarding acceptability of the patient-educational booklet. Overall, at the 1-month follow-up, approximately two thirds (15/24) of participants had an increase in motivation and self-efficacy scores and had discussed or intended to discuss their paracetamol use for LBP with a health professional. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the patient-education booklet is feasible to implement, and both the intervention and study design were well-received by participants. This study supports the undertaking an RCT to assess the effects of the patient-education booklet on deprescribing paracetamol in people with LBP.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. EDP-514 is a potent core inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) that reduces viral load reduction in HBV-infected chimeric mice. This first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of EDP-514 in healthy subjects and antiviral activity in patients with CHB. METHODS: In Part 1, 82 subjects received placebo or EDP-514 in fed or fasted state as single ascending doses of 50-800 mg and multiple ascending doses of 200-800 mg for 14 days. In Part 2, 24 HBV DNA-suppressed, nucleos(t)ide (NUC)-treated (i.e., NUC-suppressed) CHB patients received EDP-514 200-800 mg or placebo for 28 days. RESULTS: EDP-514 was well tolerated in healthy subjects and CHB patients with most adverse events of mild intensity. In Part 1, EDP-514 exposure increased in an approximately dose proportional manner up to 600 mg after single doses and up to 400 mg after 14-day dosing. In Part 2, EDP-514 exposure increased linearly with dose on Day 1 and Day 28, with some accumulation for Day 28 and median trough concentrations (C(trough)) approximately 20-fold above the protein-adjusted 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) for the dose range. Mean change in HBV RNA from baseline to Day 28 was -2.03, -1.67, -1.87, and -0.58 log U/mL in the 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg, and placebo CHB groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EDP-514 was well tolerated, had a PK profile supporting once daily dosing, and reduced HBV RNA levels in NUC-suppressed CHB patients.\n",

      "Abstract: The regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in HBV-associated HCC pathogenesis has been reported previously. This study aimed to investigate the association between serum miR-125b and liver fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients after nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) treatment. Baseline serum miR-125b levels and other relevant laboratory data were measured for 124 patients who underwent 12-month NA therapy. Post-12-month NA therapy, serum miR-125, platelet, AST, and ALT levels were measured again for post-treatment FIB-4 index calculation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for a higher post-treatment FIB-4 index. Results showed that baseline miR-125b levels were inversely correlated with the post-treatment FIB-4 index (rho = -0.2130, p = 0.0082). In logistic regression analyses, age (OR = 1.17, p &lt; 0.0001), baseline platelet level (OR = 0.98, p = 0.0032), and ALT level (OR = 1.00, p = 0.0241) were independent predictors of FIB-index &gt; 2.9 post-12-month treatment. The baseline miR-125b level was not significantly associated with a higher post-treatment FIB-4 index (p = 0.8992). In 59 patients receiving entecavir (ETV) monotherapy, the alternation of serum miR-125b in 12 months and age were substantially associated with a higher post-treatment FIB-4 index (&gt; 2.9), suggesting that miR-125b is a reliable biomarker for detecting early liver fibrosis under specific anti-HBV NA treatments (e.g., ETV).\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Women have higher rates of acute complications after left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO). However, data on long-term safety and effectiveness are limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine sex-specific short- and long-term outcomes after LAAO in the Amulet IDE (Amplatzer Amulet LAA Occluder) trial. METHODS: The following outcomes were compared between men and women: in-hospital complications, device-related outcomes (peridevice leak at 45 days and device-related thrombus at 18 months), and long-term clinical outcomes (death, thromboembolism, and bleeding). Subanalyses for the interaction between sex and device type were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1,833 patients underwent attempted device implantation (917 with the Amulet and 916 with the Watchman), of whom 734 were women (40%). Device success was 97.4% in men and 97.1% in women (P = 0.60). Rates of major in-hospital adverse events were higher in women (4.4% vs 1.9%; P < 0.01), driven by major bleeding (3.7% vs 1.0%; P < 0.01) and pericardial effusion requiring intervention (2.0% vs 0.5%; P < 0.01). Peridevice leak and device-related thrombus were similar in men and women (18.3% vs 18.9% [P = 0.78] and 3.3% vs 5.0% [P = 0.10], respectively). There were no differences between men and women in rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (2.6% vs 2.6%; P = 0.98), transient ischemic attack (1.3% vs 1.6%; P = 0.69), hemorrhagic stroke (0.5% vs 0.4%; P = 0.88), major bleeding (10.1% vs 10.9%; P = 0.49), cardiovascular death (4.3% vs 3.5%; P = 0.45), or all-cause death (8.9% vs 6.9%; P = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: In the Amulet IDE trial, long-term clinical outcomes including effectiveness following LAAO were comparable in men and women despite the higher rates of in-hospital complications due to major bleeding and pericardial effusion in women.

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peridevice leak (PDL) is a limitation of left atrial appendage occlusion. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of and outcomes associated with PDL in the Amulet IDE (AMPLATZER Amulet LAA Occluder Trial) randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients with atrial fibrillation at increased stroke risk were randomly assigned to undergo either Amulet (dual occlusive mechanism) or Watchman 2.5 (single occlusive mechanism) device implantation. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed at 45 days and 12 months postprocedure. Clinically significant PDL was defined as >/=3 mm. The primary endpoint was ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, and the secondary endpoint was stroke, systemic embolism, or cardiovascular death. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 18-month cumulative event rates landmarked at day 45 postprocedure. RESULTS: A total of 1,593 patients underwent successful left atrial appendage occlusion and had an evaluable transesophageal echocardiographic studies at 45 days. The dual-occlusive mechanism device provided superior closure (defined as leak <3 mm) compared with the single-occlusive mechanism device at 45 days (88.9% vs 74.1%; P < 0.01) and 12 months (90.5% vs. 78.3%; P < 0.01). Through 18 months, PDL was associated with a higher, but not statistically significant, risk for the primary endpoint (3.6% vs 1.8%; adjusted HR: 1.98; 95% CI: 0.93-4.19; P = 0.07) and a statistically significantly higher risk for the secondary endpoint (8.1% vs. 4.7%; adjusted HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.02-2.69; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The dual-occlusive mechanism device provided superior closure compared with the single-occlusive mechanism device at both 45 days and 1 year postprocedure. PDL >/=3 mm was associated with a significantly increased 18-month risk for the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, or cardiovascular death. Completeness of closure of the left atrial appendage has important implications for patient outcomes. (AMPLATZER Amulet LAA Occluder Trial [Amulet IDE]; NCT02879448).\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion is an alternative therapy to oral anticoagulants to reduce stroke risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The Amulet IDE trial compared the Amplatzer Amulet occluder (Abbott) with the Watchman 2.5 device (Boston Scientific) for LAA occlusion in patients with NVAF. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe outcomes of the Amulet IDE trial roll-in cohort. METHODS: At US sites up to 3 patients per implanter could be implanted with the Amulet occluder in the roll-in phase. The primary Endpoints in the Amulet IDE trial included safety (composite of procedure-related complications, all-cause death, or major bleeding at 12 months), effectiveness (composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 18 months), and rate of LAA occlusion at 45 days. RESULTS: A total of 201 roll-in patients were enrolled. Device success occurred in 99% of patients, and device closure (residual jet </=5 mm) was observed in 98.9% of patients at 45 days. The safety endpoint rate was numerically higher (worse) in the roll-in cohort compared to the randomized Amulet occluder cohort (18.4% vs 14.5%). Six patients (3.1%) experienced an ischemic stroke and 0 patients with a systemic embolism within 18 months, which was similar to the primary effectiveness endpoint rate in the randomized Amulet occluder cohort (2.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite lack of experience of the operators with the Amulet occluder in the roll-in phase, device implant success was high, a high rate of device closure was achieved, and low stroke rates were observed in patients with NVAF.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of decompensated cirrhosis and liver cancer worldwide. Newborn HBV vaccination was implemented in Spain two decades ago, and potent oral antivirals entecavir and tenofovir were introduced around 2007. AIM: To assess the clinical benefits of these interventions nationwide. METHODS: Including HBV as a diagnosis, we performed a retrospective study of all hospitalisations in Spain the Spanish National Registry of Hospital Discharges. Information was retrieved from 1997 to 2017. RESULTS: From 73,939,642 nationwide hospital admissions during the study period, 129,634 (0.17%) included HBV as diagnosis. Their number doubled from 2007 to 2017 and the median age increased from 44 to 58 years. Most HBV admissions recorded chronic hepatitis B. In-hospital death occurred in 6.4%. Co-infection with HIV or hepatitis C virus occurred in 11.9% and 23.3%, respectively. Patients with HIV-HBV co-infection had significantly greater mortality than individuals with HBV mono-infection. The rate of HBV hospitalisations significantly increased over time with a transient drop around 2007, coincident with the arrival of new potent oral antivirals. Although the proportion of HBV hepatic decompensation events has declined, the rate of liver cancer continues to rise. The small subset of patients with hepatitis delta superinfection increasingly and disproportionately accounts for hepatic decompensation events and liver cancer. CONCLUSION: Hospital admissions of individuals with HBV infection are increasing in Spain. While hepatic decompensation events declined following the introduction of potent oral nucleos(t)ide therapy, HBV-related liver cancer is rising. No benefit of oral antiviral therapies is seen on hepatitis delta.\n",

      "Abstract: Nucleoside/Nucleotide analogues (NAs) are widely used for the antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), however, it is difficult to achieve serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss with NAs therapy. In recent years, several prospective trails have reported that HBsAg loss (functional cure or clinical cure) also occurs in a small number of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative CHB patients who discontinued long-term treatment with NAs. Accordingly, the \"stop-to-cure\" strategy is proposed. Although the mechanism has not been fully elucidated, the known factors related to serum HBsAg loss with NAs withdrawal include HBV genotype, duration of NAs treatment, serum HBsAg and HBV RNA levels at end-of-treatment, and ethnic differences. In the review, we discuss the best time to stop NAs therapy, the potential markers for predicting relapse after cessation of NAs and the possible mechanism of \"stop-to-cure\" in HBeAg-negative CHB patients, and propose some suggestions on the time of retreatment.\n",

      "Abstract: Nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) cannot completely suppress the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This study aimed to identify the risk factors for HCC development in naive CHB patients treated with current NA. Patients receiving NA (n = 905) were recruited retrospectively from the 17 hospitals of the Japanese Red Cross Liver Study Group. All treatment-naive patients had been receiving current NA continuously for more than 1 year until the end of the follow-up. We analyzed the accuracy of predictive risk score using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve. The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score was significantly improved by NA therapy (-0.171 +/- 0.396; p < 0.001 at Week 48). A total of 72 (8.0%) patients developed HCC over a median follow-up of 6.2 (1.03-15.7) years. An independent predictive factor of HCC development was older age, cirrhosis, lower platelet counts at baseline and ALBI score, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at 1 year after NA therapy according to multivariate analysis. The accuracy was assessed using the PAGE-B, mPAGE-B, aMAP, APA-B, and REAL-B scores that included these factors. Discrimination was generally acceptable for these models. aMAP and REAL-B demonstrated high discrimination with 0.866/0.862 and 0.833/0.859 for 3- and 5-year prediction from the status of 1 year after NA therapy, respectively. Baseline age and platelet count, as well as ALBI and AFP one year after NA, were useful for stratifying carcinogenesis risk. The aMAP and REAL-B scores were validated with high accuracy in Japanese CHB patients.\n",

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study is to report the 1-year clinical and radiographic outcomes and safety profile of patients who underwent lumbar facet arthroplasty through implantation of the Total Posterior Spine System (TOPS) device. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbar facet arthroplasty is one proposed method of dynamic stabilization to treat grade-1 spondylolisthesis with stenosis; however, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved devices for facet arthroplasty. METHODS: Standard demographic information was collected for each patient. Radiographic parameters and patient-reported outcome measures were assessed preoperatively and at regular postoperative intervals. Complication and reoperation data were also collected for each patient. RESULTS: At the time of this study, 153 patients had undergone implantation of the TOPS device. The mean surgical time was 187.8 minutes and the mean estimated blood loss was 205.7cc. The mean length of hospital stay was 3.0 days. Mean Oswestry Disability Index, Visual Analog Score leg and back, and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire scores improved significantly at all postoperative time points (P>0.001). There were no clinically significant changes in radiographic parameters, and all operative segments remained mobile at 1-year follow-up. Postoperative complications occurred in 11 patients out of the 153 patients (7.2%) who underwent implantation of the TOPS device. Nine patients (5.9%) underwent a total of 13 reoperations, 1 (0.6%) of which was for device-related failure owing to bilateral L5 pedicle screw loosening. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar facet arthroplasty with the TOPS device demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in all patient-reported outcome measures and the ability to maintain motion at the index level while limiting sagittal translation with a low complication rate.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy reduces liver disease but requires prolonged therapy to achieve hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss. There is limited North American real-world data using non-invasive tools for fibrosis assessment and few have compared 1(st) generation NA or lamivudine (LAM) to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). AIM: To assess impact of NA on virological response and fibrosis regression using liver stiffness measurement (LSM) (i.e., FibroScan((R))). METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study from the Canadian HBV Network. Data collected included demographics, NA, HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and LSM. Patients were HBV monoinfected patients, treatment naive, and received 1 NA with minimum 1 year follow-up. RESULTS: In 465 (median 49 years, 37% female, 35% hepatitis B e antigen(+) at baseline, 84% Asian, 6% White, and 9% Black). Percentage of 64 (n = 299) received TDF and 166 were LAM-treated with similar median duration of 3.9 and 3.7 years, respectively. The mean baseline LSM was 11.2 kPa (TDF) vs 8.3 kPa (LAM) (P = 0.003). At 5-year follow-up, the mean LSM was 7.0 kPa in TDF vs 6.7 kPa in LAM (P = 0.83). There was a significant difference in fibrosis regression between groups (i.e., mean -4.2 kPa change in TDF and -1.6 kPa in LAM, P < 0.05). The last available data on treatment showed that all had normal ALT, but more TDF patients were virologically suppressed (< 10 IU/mL) (n = 170/190, 89%) vs LAM-treated (n = 35/58, 60%) (P < 0.05). None cleared HBsAg. CONCLUSION: In this real-world North American study, approximately 5 years of NA achieves liver fibrosis regression rarely leads to HBsAg loss.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Low anti-HBc serum levels at the time of therapy cessation were linked to a higher relapse risk in predominantly HBeAg-positive cohorts. We investigated the association of anti-HBc levels with relapse in HBeAg-negative patients. METHODS: Serum levels of anti-HBc, HBsAg and HBcrAg were determined in 136 HBeAg-negative patients, participating in a vaccination trial (ABX-203, NCT02249988), before treatment cessation or vaccination. Importantly, vaccination showed no impact on relapse. The correlation between the biomarkers and their predictive value for relapse (HBV DNA >2000 IU/ml +/- ALT >2xULN) was investigated. RESULTS: After therapy cessation 50% (N = 68) of patients relapsed. Median anti-HBc prior to treatment stop was significantly higher among relapsers compared to off-treatment responders (520 IU/ml vs. 330 IU/mL, p = .0098). The optimal anti-HBc cut-off to predict relapse was 325 IU/ml according to the Youden-Index. About 35% of patients with anti-HBc level < 325 IU/ml versus 60% of those with values >/=325 IU/mL relapsed (p = .0103; sensitivity 50%, specificity 75%). Combining the optimal cut-offs of HBsAg (>3008 IU/mL) or HBcrAg (>/=1790 U/ml) with anti-HBc increased the proportion of patients with relapse to 80% (p < .0001) and 74% (p = .0006), respectively. CONCLUSION: In contrast to predominantly HBeAg-positive cohorts, in our cohort of HBeAg-negative patients lower anti-HBc levels are associated with a significantly lower relapse risk after nucleos(t)ide analogue cessation. The vast majority of included patients were either genotype B or C and the applicability to other genotypes has to be further evaluated. However, anti-HBc level as an indicator of the host response might be prospectively further explored for prediction models.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) were proved to reduce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, but data were limited on their efficacy in cirrhotic CHB patients. METHODS: A total of 447 cirrhotic CHB patients treated with tenofovir/entecavir were retrospectively analyzed and divided into HCC (n = 48) and non-HCC (n = 399) groups. The median follow-up period was 62.1 months. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients (10.7%) developed HCC during surveillance. The annual incidence rate of HCC was 2.04 per 100 person-years. The cumulative incidence of HCC was 0.9%, 9.8%, and 22.1% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Significant predictors for HCC identified using a multiple Cox regression analysis were age >/=50 years (hazard ratio (HR): 2.34) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >/=8 ng/mL (HR: 2.05). The incidence rate of HCC was 8.67-fold higher in patients with age >/=50 years and AFP >/=8 ng/mL (3.14 per 100 person-years) than those with age &lt;50 years and AFP &lt;8 ng/mL (0.36 per 100 person-years). CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhotic CHB patients with age &lt;50 years and AFP &lt;8 ng/mL had the lowest annual incidence of HCC. However, those with age >/=50 years or/and AFP >/=8 ng/mL had a significantly higher risk for HCC development and warrant a careful surveillance schedule.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: We evaluated the patterns of peripheral Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling activity and the expression of TLRs and natural killer (NK) cell activation in a cohort of patients experiencing severe hepatitis flares after stopping nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs) therapy. METHODS: Samples were collected longitudinally from patients with chronic hepatitis B who were enrolled in a prospective study of NA discontinuation. Patients experiencing hepatitis flares were compared with patients with normal alanine aminotransferase. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with TLR ligands and cytokine secretion in the cell culture supernatant measured. Expression of TLR2/4, NKG2D, NKp46, and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) on monocytes, NK, and NK-T cells was measured. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with severe reactivation hepatitis flares were compared to 12 nonflare patients. Hepatitis flares were associated with increased activity of TLR2-8 and TLR9 signaling in PBMCs at the time of peak flare compared to baseline. Hepatitis flares were also associated with (1) upregulation of TLR2 and (2) TREM-1 receptor expression on NK. There were no differences at baseline between flare patients and nonflare patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis flares off NA therapy have a significant innate inflammatory response with upregulation of TLR signaling on peripheral monocytes and TLR2 and TREM-1 expression on NK cells. This implicates the innate immune system in the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis B flares.\n",

      "Abstract: Expanding access to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a major tool for management of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. However, rising levels of HIV drug-resistance have significantly hampered the anticipated success of ART in persons living with HIV (PLWH), particularly those from Africa. Though great strides have been made in Ghana toward achieving the UNAIDS \"95-95-95\" target, a substantial number of PLWH receiving ART have not attained viral suppression. This study investigated patterns of drug resistance mutations in ART naive as well as ART-experienced PLWH receiving first-line regimen drugs from Ghana. In a cross-sectional study, blood samples were collected from HIV-1 infected adults (>/=18 years) attending HIV/AIDS clinic at the Eastern Regional Hospital, Koforidua, Ghana from September to October 2017. Viral RNA isolated from plasma were subjected to genotypic drug resistance testing for Protease Inhibitors (PI), Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTI), and Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTI). A total of 95 (84 ART experienced, 11 ART naive) HIV-1 infected participants were sampled in this study. Sixty percent (50/84) of the ART-experienced participants were controlling viremia (viral load < 1,000 copies/ml). Of the 95 patient samples, 32, 34, and 33 were successfully sequenced for protease, reverse-transcriptase, and integrase regions, respectively. The dominant HIV-1 subtypes detected were CRF02_AG (70%), and A3 (10%). Major drug resistance associated mutations were only detected for reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The predominant drug resistance mutations were against nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)-M184V/I and non-nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-K103N. In the ART-experienced group, M184V/I and K103N were detected in 54% (15/28) and 46% (13/28) of individuals, respectively. Both mutations were each detected in 33% (2/6) of ART naive individuals. Multiclass resistance to NRTI and NNRTI was detected in 57% of ART-experienced individuals and two ART naive individuals. This study reports high-level resistance to NNRTI-based antiretroviral therapy in PLWH in Ghana. However, the absence of major PI and INSTI associated-mutations is a good signal that the current WHO recommendation of Dolutegravir in combination with an NRTI backbone will yield maximum benefits as first-line regimen for PLWH in Ghana.\n",

      "Abstract: When patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) stop nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy before achieving HBsAg loss, flares often ensue which are challenging to predict early. We determined the incidence, severity, outcome and predictors of flares after NA withdrawal. Forty-five patients enrolled in an RCT were included; 107 patients from an external, prospective cohort were used for validation. Retreatment criteria were pre-defined. Pre- and post-treatment predictors of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flare (>5x ULN) were evaluated by Cox proportional-hazards regression. Seventy-two weeks after NA withdrawal, 23/45 (51%) patients had developed >5x ULN and 14 (31%) >20x ULN. Median time to develop ALT >5x ULN was 12 weeks after NA withdrawal. Independent predictors of ALT >5x ULN were male sex (HR [95% CI] 3.2 [1.2-8.9]; p = 0.03) and serum HBV DNA (1.2 [1.0-1.8]; p = 0.03) at Week 6 off-therapy. Specifically, week 6 HBV DNA >10,000 IU/ml predicted ALT >5x ULN (3.4 [1.4-8.4]; p = 0.01), which was externally validated. In conclusion, this study on post-treatment flares revealed a high cumulative incidence in CHB. Week 6 HBV DNA >10,000 IU/ml independently predicted flares. The proposed threshold enables prediction of imminent flares in patients who may benefit from closer monitoring and earlier retreatment.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study reports the results of a prospective, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the polymer based Endologix Alto Stent Graft System in treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), with sealing 7 mm below the top of the fabric in aortic neck diameters from 16 to 30 mm. METHODS: Seventy-five patients were treated with Alto devices between March 2017 and February 2018 in 16 centers in the United States for infrarenal AAAs (max diameter >/=5.0 cm in diameter or size increase by 0.5 cm in 6 months or diameter >/=1.5 times the adjacent normal aorta). Patients were followed for 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year by clinical evaluation and computed tomography and abdominal x-ray imaging. Treatment success was defined as technical success and freedom from AAA enlargement, migration, type I or III endoleak, AAA rupture or surgical conversion, stent graft stenosis, occlusion, kink, thromboembolic events, and stent fracture attributable to the device requiring secondary intervention through 12 months. Preoperative characteristics, perioperative variables, follow-up clinical evaluations, and radiographic examination results through the first 1 year were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 73 years, with 93% of patients being male. The 30-day major adverse event rate was 5.3%. At 1 year, the primary endpoint was met with a treatment success rate of 96.7%. Through 1-year post-treatment, all-cause mortality was 4.0%. No AAA-related mortality occurred. AAA enlargement was 1.6%, type I endoleak rate was 1.4%, with 100% freedom from type III endoleaks, device migration, device fracture, stent occlusion, or AAA rupture. The device-related secondary intervention rate was 2.7%. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study demonstrates the Endologix Alto is safe and effective in treating AAAs with appropriate anatomy at 1 year. The safety endpoint is met by a 5.3% 30-day major adverse event rate, whereas the effectiveness endpoint is met by a treatment success rate of 96%.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated the dynamics of serum HBV pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) in patients receiving nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) and their predictability for favourable suppression of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). METHODS: Serum viral biomarkers were measured at baseline, weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 of treatment. Patients were followed up thereafter and the serum HBsAg level was measured at end of follow-up (EOFU). Favourable HBsAg response (FHR) was defined as </=100 IU/mL or HBsAg seroclearance upon EOFU. RESULTS: Twenty-eight HBeAg-positive and 36 HBeAg-negative patients (median 38.2 years old, 71.9% male) were recruited with median follow-up duration of 17.1 (IQR 12.8-18.2) years. For the entire cohort, 22/64 (34.4%, of which 8 achieved HBsAg seroclearance) achieved FHR. For HBeAg-positive patients, serum HBV pgRNA decline at week 4 was significantly greater for patients with FHR compared to non-FHR patients (5.49 vs 4.32 log copies/mL, respectively, p=0.016). The AUROC for week 4 HBV pgRNA reduction to predict FHR in HBeAg-positive patients was 0.825 (95% CI 0.661-0.989). For HBeAg-negative patients, instead of increase in serum HBcrAg from baseline in non-FHR patients, FHR patients had median reduction in HBcrAg at week 4 (increment of 1.75 vs reduction of 2.98 log U/mL; p=0.023). The AUROC for week 4 change of HBcrAg to predict FHR in HBeAg-negative patients was 0.789 (95% CI 0.596-0.982). CONCLUSIONS: Early on-treatment changes of serum HBV pgRNA and HBcrAg at 4 weeks predict HBsAg seroclearance or </=100 IU/mL in NA-treated CHB patients upon long-term FU.\n",

      "Abstract: The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global public health problem. This review presents updated recommendations for the optimal current treatment of choice with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA). Current clinical practice guidelines on the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) by the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases have been considered. Patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of liver disease progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. The main goal of therapy is to improve survival preventing disease progression and HCC. The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication represents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss is the optimal endpoint. The typical indication for treatment requires elevated HBV desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), elevated alanine aminotransferase and/or at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients with detectable HBV DNA should be treated. The long-term administration of a potent NA with high barrier to resistance, ie, entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of choice. However, HBsAg seroclearance is anecdotal with NA. Treated patients should be monitored for therapy response, adherence, risk of disease progression, and risk of HCC development. This review aims to assess the evolving trends on the potent NA and the new perspectives on finite therapy.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To understand the experience of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) receiving idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel), a B-cell maturation antigen-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, in the pivotal, phase 2 KarMMa trial. METHODS: Optional semi-structured interviews before leukapheresis (pre-treatment) captured expectations and after ide-cel infusion (1, 2, and 3 months post-treatment), assessed treatment experience, ide-cel advantages/disadvantages, and health and well-being. In a mixed-method analysis, treatment experiences were categorized by clinical response status, health and well-being, and self-reported recovery after infusion. RESULTS: Pre-treatment interviews indicated unmet treatment needs. In post-treatment interviews, most patients reported the positives of ide-cel outweighed negatives (69%, n = 27/39). Most common advantages of ide-cel were efficacy (18-64%), favorable side-effect profile (46-68%), and recovery time (13-18%); most common disadvantages were related to side effects (13-20%). When analyzed by clinical response, patients most often had stringent complete or very good partial response and improved health and well-being with mild or severe recovery from the infusion (27/58, 47%). Most patients with minimal clinical response reported mild infusion recovery (5/6, 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Patient interviews before ide-cel treatment showed unmet needs in triple-class exposed RRMM. Post-treatment experiences generally favored ide-cel versus previously received treatments.\n",

      "Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infection, causing immune dysfunction and chronic hepatitis, is one of the leading risk factors for hepatocellular cancer. We investigated how Arthrospira affected hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reduction in CHB patients under continued nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA). Sixty CHB patients who had been receiving NA for at least one year with undetectable HBV DNA were randomized into three groups: control and oral Arthrospira at 3 or 6 g daily add-on therapy groups. Patients were followed up for 6 months. Oral Arthrospira-diet mice were established to investigate the possible immunological mechanism of Arthrospira against HBV. Within 6 months, mean quantitative HBsAg (qHBsAg) decreased in the oral Arthrospira add-on therapy group. Interestingly, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) increased but TNF-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), hepatic fibrosis, and steatosis decreased in the add-on groups. In mice, Arthrospira enhanced both innate and adaptive immune system, especially natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, B cell activation, and the interleukin 2 (IL-2), IFN-gamma immune response. Arthrospira may modulate IL-2- and TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma-mediated B and T cell activation to reduce HBsAg. Also, Arthrospira has the potential to restore immune tolerance and enhance HBsAg seroclearance in CHB patients through promoting T, B, and NK cell activation.\n",

      "Abstract: Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitous zinc metalloprotease implicated in the efficient degradation of insulin monomer. However, IDE also degrades monomers of amyloidogenic peptides associated with disease, complicating the development of IDE inhibitors. In this work, we investigated the effects of the lipid composition of membranes on the IDE-dependent degradation of insulin. Kinetic analysis based on chromatography and insulin's helical circular dichroic signal showed that the presence of anionic lipids in membranes enhances IDE's activity toward insulin. Using NMR spectroscopy, we discovered that exchange broadening underlies the enhancement of IDE's activity. These findings, together with the adverse effects of anionic membranes in the self-assembly of IDE's amyloidogenic substrates, suggest that the lipid composition of membranes is a key determinant of IDE's ability to balance the levels of its physiologically and pathologically relevant substrates and achieve proteostasis.\n",

      "Abstract: AIM: To determine whether a decrease in HBsAg to <0.05 IU/mL could be a criterion for cessation of finite nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 6715 patients with CHB between January 1998 and May 2016. Patients were followed up every 12-24 weeks. Among 104 patients achieving HBsAg levels < 0.05 IU/mL, 71 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis: 31 received finite NUC therapy, and 40 received indefinite NUC therapy. In the finite therapy group, 9 patients received no NUC consolidation therapy, 6 received short-term (<1 year) consolidation, and 16 received long-term (>1 year) consolidation. The outcome measures were alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, albumin, hepatitis B virus DNA, and HBsAg levels. RESULTS: Baseline parameters and characteristics at the time when HBsAg levels had fallen to <0.05 IU/mL were similar between the finite and indefinite therapy groups. No patients experienced viral breakthrough/relapse during a median follow-up of 120 weeks. There were little or no differences in long-term outcomes between the finite and indefinite therapy groups and between the short-term and long-term consolidation groups. CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of NUCs may be acceptable in patients whose HBsAg levels fall to <0.05 IU/mL. Consolidation therapy lasting <1 year appears adequate to prevent poor long-term prognosis.\n",

      "Abstract: AIMS: Induction of a durable viral response is difficult to achieve in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), even from long-term use of a nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA). This study investigated whether switching to peginterferon (PegIFN) alfa-2a after long-term NA therapy induced a durable viral response. METHODS: Patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB who received any NA for at least 72 weeks and had a low level of HBV DNA (</=100 IU/mL) were randomized (1:1) to receive PegIFN alfa-2a (180 mug/week) or NA for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) titer during antiviral therapy. RESULTS: We randomized 149 CHB patients to the two groups. Compared to baseline, the HBsAg levels in both groups were not lower at week 12, but were lower after 24, 36, and 48 weeks (all p<0.001). The maximal HBsAg decline in the PegIFN alfa-2a group was at week 36 (0.50+/-0.88 log10 IU/mL), and this decline was smaller in the NA group (0.08+/-0.46 log10 IU/mL). The percentage of patients with HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 was also greater in the PegIFN alfa-2a group (15/75 [20.0%] vs. 5/74 [6.8%], p = 0.018). Multivariable analysis indicated the PegIFN alfa-2a group had a greater change in HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 (p = 0.027). Patients had relatively good tolerance to PegIFN alfa-2a therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CHB patients who switched to PegIFN alfa-2a for 48 weeks had a significantly lower HBsAg titer and increased HBeAg seroconversion relative to those who remained on NA therapy.

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Few clinical trials and cohort studies have evaluated the efficacy of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) in people with HIV (PWH) with preexisting M184V/I or other nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance-associated mutations (RAMs). Real-world data are also scarce. METHODS: Retrospective review of treatment-experienced patients who started B/F/TAF in a cohort of PWH. HIV-RNA less than 50 copies/ml was analyzed at 48 weeks in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (missing=failure) and per protocol analysis (patients with missing data or changes for reasons other than virological failure were excluded). Results were compared in patients with and without previous NRTI-RAMs. RESULTS: Five hundred and six PWH were included (16.2% women). Median age and time with HIV infection were 52.3 and 18.9 years, respectively. At baseline, viral load was less than 50 copies/ml in 440 patients (86.6%). Overall, 69 (13.6%) participants had documented preexisting NRTI-RAMs: 57 (11.2%) M184V/I and 30 (5.9%) tenofovir RAMs. In the ITT analysis, 83% (420/506) had HIV-RNA less than 50 copies/ml [82.2% (359/437) and 88.4% (61/69) in persons without and with NRTI-RAMs, respectively ( P  = 0.2)]. In the per protocol analysis 94.2% (420/445) had HIV-RNA less than 50 copies/ml [94.4% (359/380) vs. 93.8% (61/65); P  = 0.2]. A total of 61 participants were excluded from the per protocol analysis (23 missing data, 19 discontinued B/F/TAF because of toxicity, 13 for other reasons, and 6 died). CONCLUSION: Switching to B/F/TAF is well tolerated and effective in the real-world setting, even in patients with preexisting NRTI RAMs, such as M184V and RAMs conferring resistance to tenofovir. These results confirm the robustness of this combination.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cessation of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is uncommon. Although criteria for discontinuation appear in some guidelines, the indicators for assessing discontinuation of NAs are limited, whether NAs can be safely ceased remains a difficult clinical issue. Our study aimed to investigate the role of serum pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) at the end of treatment (EOT) in guiding the safe discontinuation of NAs in CHB patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective study, clinical data of all CHB patients who discontinued NAs treatment at West China Hospital between June 2020 and January 2021 were collected, including EOT pgRNA, HBcrAg, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), etc. All patients should meet the Asian-Pacific guideline for discontinuation. Observing virological relapse (VR) rates during 1 year of NAs discontinuation and analyzing the relationship between EOT pgRNA, HBcrAg, and VR. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were enrolled in this study and 33 (51.5%) patients experienced VR in 1 year. EOT pgRNA positivity (OR = 14.59, p = 0.026) and EOT higher HBcrAg levels (OR = 14.14, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for VR. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) value of EOT HBcrAg for VR was 0.817 (p < 0.001), optimal cut-off value was 3.3 log10 U/mL. Patients with EOT pgRNA positivity and EOT HBcrAg >3.3 log10 U/mL were more likely to experience VR after discontinuation of NAs (88.9 vs. 45.5%, p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: According to current guidelines, a higher VR rate occurs after cessation of NAs. EOT pgRNA positivity and higher HBcrAg level carries a higher risk of VR. Combining these novel markers can better help us assess whether patients can safely cease NAs treatment.\n",

The preferential affinity of this enzyme for insulin\\nresults in insulin-mediated inhibition of the degradation of other\\npeptides such as beta-amyloid. Deficiencies in this protein's\\nfunction are associated with Alzheimer's disease and type 2\\ndiabetes mellitus but mutations in this gene have not been shown to\\nbe causitive for these diseases.

The preferential affinity of this enzyme for insulin\\nresults in insulin-mediated inhibition of the degradation of other\\npeptides such as beta-amyloid. Deficiencies in this protein's\\nfunction are associated with Alzheimer's disease and type 2\\ndiabetes mellitus but mutations in this gene have not been shown to\\nbe causitive for these diseases. This protein localizes primarily\\nto the cytoplasm but in some cell types localizes to the\\nextracellular space, cell membrane, peroxisome, and mitochondrion.\\nAlternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants\\nencoding distinct isoforms. Additional transcript variants have\\nbeen described but have not been experimentally verified.[provided\\nby RefSeq, Sep 2009].\\nTranscript Variant: This variant (1) encodes the longest protein\\n(isoform 1). Alternative translation initiation of this transcript\\nvariant produces an isoform that lacks 41 aa from the N-terminus\\nand, purportedly, lacks an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting\\nsequence.\\nPublication Note:  This RefSeq record includes a subset of the\\npublications that are available for this gene.
